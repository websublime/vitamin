Initial CSS themer utils, rules, classes.

Notes:
Reinitate all project with new structure and new styling. Remove all old code and start from scratch.
Why? Tailwind is too big, as its powers but seems crazy the way we build now css. So long classes and so many repetition.
Extending take a lot of work creating plugins and stuff. So we want to create a new way to build css, more like a framework.
